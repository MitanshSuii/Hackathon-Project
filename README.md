Our goal is to stand up against bullying by giving students a safe online space to speak up. Through our website, students can report bullying privately to teachers without any pressure or judgment. They can also choose to share concerns publicly, or chat one-on-one with trained counsellors who are ready to listen and help.
We want every student to know they’re not alone, and that there’s always someone ready to support them.
